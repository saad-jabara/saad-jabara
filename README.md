# Saad Jabara — AI Engineer | Python Developer | RAG Practitioner

## About Me

I'm Saad Jabara — an AI engineer focused on building retrieval-augmented, context-aware systems that combine semantic search with large language models.

With roots in data analytics and Python development, I now specialize in RAG architectures, designing pipelines that convert unstructured text into accurate, source-grounded responses. I work extensively with LangChain, ChromaDB, and OpenAI models to build practical and modular retrieval systems.

## Projects

### 1. RAG From Scratch (Core Project)

**Python | LangChain | ChromaDB | OpenAI API**

An end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation system built fully from scratch.

**Includes:**
- Document ingestion & chunking
- Embedding generation using OpenAI
- Vector storage & semantic retrieval with ChromaDB
- Custom retriever logic & modular chain design
- Context-aware answer generation with source attribution

### 2. RAG Learning Journey

To deepen my AI engineering capabilities, I completed a hands-on RAG training where I implemented the entire retrieval pipeline myself.

The goal wasn't just to understand concepts, but to build them directly in code and see how each part affects system accuracy and performance.

**I worked with:**
- Full RAG flow (indexing → retrieval → generation)
- Advanced query translation: multi-query, RAG fusion, decomposition, step-back prompting, HyDE
- Query routing & dynamic query construction
- Multi-representation indexing (RAPTOR, ColBERT)
- Corrective retrieval (CRAG)
- Adaptive retrieval for improved reliability
- Custom retriever chains built with LangChain

This experience enabled me to build robust, production-style RAG systems with reasoning, routing, and adaptive behaviors.

### 3. Movie Correlation Analysis

**Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib**

Analyzed which variables influence movie gross revenue through correlation and visual exploration.
